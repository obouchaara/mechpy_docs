Welcome to the first post in the `MechPy Docs`! This blog is dedicated to sharing insights, tutorials, and updates related to mechanical engineering concepts and their applications in Python programming.

In the `_posts` directory of our Jekyll site, you will find our blog posts. To add new content, we simply create a file in this directory with the format `YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-post.md` and include the necessary front matter, similar to this post.

MechPy Docs aims to provide an interactive and insightful resource for both beginners and experienced individuals in the field. We focus on a range of topics from basic mechanical engineering principles to advanced computational methods in Python.

We'll be updating this site with more tutorials, guides, and discussions. Stay tuned for regular updates and feel free to contribute or suggest topics that interest you!
